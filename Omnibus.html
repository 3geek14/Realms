<h2 id="what-is-the-realms">1.1: What is the Realms?</h2>
<p>The Realms is a medieval fantasy Live Action Role Playing (LARP) system (also known as The Realms of Wonder). This game has been in existence since the late 1980s. The Realms has evolved considerably since its inception through the participation and imagination of more people than can be credited. Unlike most LARPs today, the Realms has a skill-based combat system, and is community-based rather than run by a single, static council or corporation.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with what playing in a LARP entails, it is a lot like acting. The difference is that while the event staff sets the stage, the lines are all yours. You decide what “part” you want to play. Are you a mage, a warrior, a noble, or all of the above? Once you arrive at the event site you slip into your character. You stop acting like yourself and begin acting like your new persona. The Realms uses foam-padded “weapons” to simulate combat and has an intricate magic system to represent all sorts of things we wouldn’t be able to do in real life. The system is designed to help resolve situations that we cannot practically resolve on our own. Specifics of the Realms system will be discussed in more detail later on. You’re in the Realms now and you’ll never be quite the same again.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-book">1.2: What is This Book?</h2>
<p>The document you are reading is the official rulebook to the Realms. Covered here you will find what you need to know about combat, magic, and other aspects of playing the game.</p>
<p>Be sure to know the 2018 Omnibus rules, as well as any specific rules at each event you attend. At their events, an Event Holder (a player who volunteers to run an event, hereafter referred to as an EH) may choose to change some of the rules, including (among other things) announcing special weapon calls, defining special event-specific spells (Regional Magic), and allowing play-testing of new rules.</p>
<p>The game rules and the rulebook are updated once a year by a council of EHs in order to make the game more fun, make the game safer, clarify existing rules, and encourage increased, improved role-playing. For more information on events and the Realms, visit <a href="www.realmsnet.net">realmsnet.net</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-start-playing">1.3: How Do I Start Playing?</h2>
<p>First off, read this rulebook. Read the whole thing. It is also a good idea to re-read the Omnibus each year so you can be up-to-date on rules modifications and changes that occur during the Event-Holders Council.</p>
<p>Next, you will need to make a character (the role you play while at events). Characters are often referred to as Player Characters or PCs. This role will be the vehicle you experience the Realms through. Creating a character is old hat to many who have played tabletop role-playing games or other LARPs. If you are unfamiliar with creating a character or want some tips, see <a href="#character-creation">Part 5: Character Creation.</a></p>
<p>After creating a PC, the best way to become acquainted with the Realms is to simply go to an event. Most people will be happy to explain to you what’s going on. There is so much that can happen at an event that it is better experienced than explained. Attending practices is also helpful, as you not only become acquainted with the combat system, but also get introduced to other players.</p>
<h3 id="realms-events">Realms Events</h3>
<p>An event is where the game is played. There are basically three kinds of events in the Realms: Feasts, Tournaments, and Quests. Some events take on qualities of all the types, but are predominantly one of the three. Here is what to expect at each type:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Feasts</dt>
<dd>Feasts, as the name implies, revolve around food. Political posturing and court are often held at feast events. There is generally little combat at a feast event, and they are usually held indoors in the wintertime. Bardics, games of chance or skill, and other such activities can usually be found at feasts. Feasts are often a good starting point for some players, particularly those more interested in role-playing than in combat.
</dd>
<dt>Tournaments</dt>
<dd>Tournament events usually feature contests of both individual and team martial skill. These are usually held as yearly events, and are generally a social occasion. Players more interested in combat and less interested in role-playing and magic find tournament events the best starting point for their Realms careers.
</dd>
<dt>Quests</dt>
<dd>Quest events are the traditional style of event for saving damsels in distress, finding and killing evil demons, and many other tasks. Nearly anything can happen at a quest event.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="attending-an-event">1.4: Attending an Event</h2>
<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>
<p>A list of events can be found on realmsnet.net under the Realms Calendar or the Events tab. Whenever you plan on attending an event, you should register for it through realmsnet.net as some events may have caps on how many players can attend, while others may have different registration requirements or pre-event information to disperse to players who are planning on attending. Registering for events also helps give the event staff an idea of how many players they might expect, and helps them to plan accordingly. It is also important to register any dietary or medical restrictions you may have.</p>
<h3 id="check-in">Check In</h3>
<p>When you arrive at an event, there are a few things you must do before beginning play:</p>
<h3 id="event-fees">Event Fees</h3>
<p>You must pay any event fees; failure to do so means you will not be able participate in the event and may be asked to leave site. Some events will waive event fees for staff or NPCs (Non Player Characters) however, you must alway check with the event holder first. As event fees help pay for the site, props, prizes, food, and costuming that goes into throwing events, without them future events would not be able to occur.</p>
<h3 id="waivers">Waivers</h3>
<p>You may be required to sign a waiver. Waivers serve two purposes: protection for the EH(s) or the land owners from legal action, and to keep track of how many people attended an event. Monitoring event attendance is the way for the Event Holders’ Council to determine whether or not an event is legal (more on what makes a legal event in <a href="#realms-administration">Part 7: Realms Administration</a>).</p>
<h3 id="magic-items">Magic Items</h3>
<p>Magic items must be checked in with the EH or the event’s Magic Marshal (MM) before the start of the event. EHs and MMs must know about every magic item at an event, so that the event can be adjusted, if necessary. EHs and MMs have the right to fail or disallow any magic item at any time. Using a magic item at an event without first gaining approval by the EH or MM is cheating.</p>
<h3 id="magic-check-in">Magic</h3>
<p>Spellcasters must check their spellbook with the EH or the event’s MM to find out whether any of their spells work differently at the event before they cast any of their spells. Spellcasters with Regional Magic (see <a href="#regional-magic">Regional Magic</a>) also generally find out what their magic of the day is at check-in. Using spells at an event without first gaining approval by the EH or MM is cheating.</p>
<h3 id="weapon-inspection">Weapon Inspection</h3>
<p>Before beginning play, you must inspect your own weapons before they are used. If you are unsure of a weapon’s safety, ask a marshal to inspect it for you. EHs may require a designated marshal (referee) to inspect all weapons to make sure they are safe for use. There must always be someone at an event who can be asked to inspect weapons in case anyone does not feel comfortable inspecting their own weapons. If a weapon is deemed unsafe, it is to be removed from play or repaired.</p>
<h2 id="alcohol-policy">1.5: Alcohol Policy</h2>
<p>Alcohol is not permitted unless explicitly allowed by the Event Holder. An event advertised as damp or wet is informing attendants that alcohol is allowed in accordance with state and federal laws.</p>
<h1 id="core-rules">2: Core Rules</h1>
<h2 id="participant-rights">2.1: Participant Rights</h2>
<p>The Realms is committed to providing a space that feels as safe and inclusive as possible. Participants in the Realms have the out-of-character rights to personal safety and the expectation they will be treated with courtesy and respect by all other participants in the Realms. Participants have the right to bring concerns to a marshal or other responsible staff member with the expectation of having them investigated and appropriately addressed.</p>
<p>Every player has an obligation to read and follow the rules of the Omnibus. EHs understand that the game can be complex and the first step in dealing with behavioral issues or cheating in most instances involves ensuring that the player understands the rules.</p>
<p>However, if a rule is broken, or if there are repeated infractions, an EH may impose consequences on any participant(s) at their event. These may include a formal warning; removal from specific sections of an event; removal from an event; not being allowed to use specific weapons, spells, or items; or prosecution for violations of Federal and/or State law. If you are removed from an event for rules violations, the EH is not obligated to refund your event fee.</p>
<p>If an EH subjects a player to a consequence at their event they should notify all other EHs of this via the Event Holders’ List. The player involved must receive a copy of this notification and may send a formal response. People who want to bring formal charges should report such charges to the Arbitration Committee (<a href="mailto:arbitration@lists.realmsnet.net">arbitration@lists.realmsnet.net</a>). In addition, any participant that feels wrongful action was taken against them can bring the issue before the Arbitration Committee (see <a href="#arbitration-committee">Section 7.3</a>.</p>
<p>An EH may opt to not allow a player who has a history of breaking rules to attend their events, provided that player is notified in advance.</p>
<p>Event Holders have an obligation to take reports of rules violations at their events seriously. Having an additional person present during the reporting is strongly encouraged. If you report a violation to the EH of an event and are ignored or no reasonable action is taken, bring the situation to the attention of the Arbitration Committee. Event Holders who have a history of disregarding reports of rules violations, or who do not address especially serious reports may face penalties including, but not limited to, temporary loss of EH status, un-backing of that EH’s magic item(s), revocation of an event’s legal status, and/or being banned from holding future events.</p>
<p>Reports of rules violations to be submitted after the conclusion of an event should be submitted to the AC.</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">2.2: Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Anyone can report harassment or abuse. If someone’s behavior towards you has violated your rights as a participant, or if you witness the same happening to someone else, immediately report the incident to the EH.</p>
<p>If you have reason to believe rules regarding the Code of Conduct may be violated at an event, you should notify the Event Holder prior to the event occurring.</p>
<p>The following list is not meant to be exhaustive, and any non-consensual violations of a participant’s rights should be considered a violation of the rules.</p>
<p>Any of the following constitute grounds for punitive action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violating any federal, state, or local laws, facility rules, or event policies;</li>
<li>Failure to comply with the instructions of the Event Holder or designated marshal;</li>
<li>Using anything in an out-of-character threatening or destructive manner against person or property;</li>
<li>Endangering the safety of oneself or others;</li>
<li>Stealing (People’s tents, bags, packs, pouches, and possessions are completely off-limits and out-of-play. There are no exceptions, even if officially in-play items are concealed therein);</li>
<li>Drinking alcohol under the age of 21, or providing alcohol to those under age 21;</li>
<li>Physical or verbal intimidation or abuse;</li>
<li>Stalking;</li>
<li>Inappropriate physical contact or proximity. Any form of unwanted physical contact is strictly forbidden;</li>
<li>Non-consensual sexual acts (a person under the age of consent cannot consent to sexual acts);</li>
<li>Inappropriate sexual attention, whether verbal or physical, or continued attention after being asked to stop (sexual attention towards those legally or physically unable to consent is always inappropriate, this includes people under the age of consent);</li>
<li>Harassment for any reason, including out-of-game attributes such as race, weight, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or disability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Role-play can never be used as an excuse for any of these behaviors. If you are informed that your role-playing is OOC unsafe, threatening, or is not consented to by other participants you should stop immediately and find another way to play out the scene.</p>
<h2 id="the-safety-rules">2.3: The Safety Rules</h2>
<p>The safety rules are out-of-character (hereafter referred to as OOC). They are for our safety, and provide the guidelines that we should all be playing by.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-we-play-by">The Rules We Play By</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>We should all be doing this to have fun. If you get mad or uncontrolled, it is up to you to remove yourself from the game until you have regained your composure.</li>
<li>This is a sport of personal honor; treat it as such. You are responsible for keeping track of many aspects of this game, such as weapon blows and known spells. Failure to report or accurately respond to any of these aspects is cheating and a stain on your personal honor.</li>
<li>You must listen to the marshals at all times; they are the referees. If you are caught breaking the rules, a marshal may remove you from all or part of that event.</li>
<li>Report any safety concerns to a marshal immediately. If you have any questions, it is up to you to ask.</li>
<li>HOLD: If you see a harmful or unsafe situation (e.g., someone is about to run into a tree, gets their glasses knocked off, has had their weapon really broken in combat, is about to fall off a cliff, etc.) yell the word “Hold.” If someone is injured, it is the primary responsibility of the person who is hurt to call a Hold. Before calling a Hold for someone else in an otherwise safe situation, you must first ask if they are all right. Holds should only be called in the event of a dangerous situation, and should never be used to discuss the rules. If you hear the word “Hold,” stop immediately, then say “Hold” until everyone else has stopped moving. Once the emergency has been dealt with, a “Lay-On” (continue play) will be called either by a qualified marshal, or the person who originally called the Hold. Do not resume play until a Lay-On has been called.</li>
<li>Only weapons and shields that have been made following the construction guidelines (see <a href="#weapon-construction">Section 3.8: Weapon Construction</a>) are to be used. Weapons should be checked between combat situations to ensure continued safety. A qualified marshal may be requested to check the safety of any weapons or shields at any time. Any new designs or materials must be inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal before use.</li>
<li>There is to be NO real steel in any combat situation, or in any potential combat situation, at any time. Real steel is defined as metal knives, swords, axes, darts, spikes, spurs, etc. - anything that could really hurt a participant. Real steel that is sheathed is still a potential hazard.</li>
<li>Acts considered unlawful in the real world, such as theft of non-game items or assault, are also unlawful in the Realms. For the safety of all participants, any form of unwanted physical contact is strictly forbidden.</li>
<li>Any spell props, weapon props, or materials not specifically allowed within the Omnibus must be inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal before they are used.</li>
<li>While the wording of the game rules may occasionally be less than clear, players should not use any such confusion to their own advantage. A simple guideline is to not assume any benefits unless they are specifically granted by a rule. If you feel that the way a rule is written grants you an advantage by omission of a statement to the contrary, you must review that rule with a marshal or EH prior to utilizing that advantage. While this document has a lot of general rules (such as <a href="#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know">Section 6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone Should Know</a>), any specific rule will always override these general rules.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-rules-we-fight-by">The Rules We Fight By</h3>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>This is a lightest touch sport. ANY contact with a weapon to a body is to be taken as a hit. Ignoring a “light” blow is cheating and a marshal may remove you from the fight. There are to be NO full-strength swings. A marshal may remove you for excessive blow strength. Weapons, melee and missile, should be used with the minimum force necessary to score a successful hit.</li>
<li>The face (eyebrows to chin) and throat area are “off-target.” Do not aim for these areas. You may choose not to accept a blow that hits you solely in these areas, but you must call the location that was hit. For instance, if you are hit in the face, call “Face,” and keep fighting if you wish. This alerts both the other combatant and the marshal that you have taken an illegal blow. It is not unusual for shots to an off-target area to also strike legitimate areas in the same strike. You must take all legal blows, even if an off-target area was hit by the same strike. For example, a shot thrown at your head may hit your face if you pull back, but if it touches your forehead in the process, that is a legal blow.</li>
<li>In combat, there is to be contact with weapons only (e.g., weapons hitting weapons, weapons hitting bodies, and weapons hitting shields only). There is to be NO body contact of any kind (e.g., no shoving, punching, kicking, biting, grabbing, etc.). Do NOT grab an opponent’s weapons and/or shield.</li>
<li>Do NOT charge. Charging is defined as running at someone so that they have to get out of your way to avoid illegal contact.</li>
<li>Shields are for blocking ONLY. Your shield should never be used as a weapon. Shield-bashing or other shield contact with another person is unsafe.</li>
<li>Pommels, no matter how padded, are not legal striking surfaces. Do not punch or thrust with the pommel of a weapon.</li>
<li>Do NOT ever throw a weapon at a participant, unless that weapon is of a type (magic missile, javelin, or lightning bolt) sanctioned by the rules for throwing. No thrown weapon or missile weapon should strike a participant above the shoulders.</li>
<li>Arrows should be drawn with minimal pull necessary to score a successful hit. Bows should NEVER be used to parry an attack. As with thrown weapons, arrows should not strike a participant above the shoulders.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="combat-in-the-realms">3: Combat in the Realms</h1>
<h2 id="the-combat-system">3.1: The Combat System</h2>
<p>The Realms uses a lightest-touch system for its combat system. That means that no matter how lightly your opponent may touch you with their weapon, you have to take the shot. This is to keep the sport friendly, so that everyone can play. This system does not allow for “scratches” or “light blows” - you must take these shots as normal blows. In all cases, the phrase, “if you are struck,” refers to any time you are struck by the padded surface of any weapon or spell prop that does damage as a weapon.</p>
<h3 id="hit-locations">Hit Locations</h3>
<p>Your body is separated into seven locations of which there are two kinds. Your arms and legs are “limbs,” while your head and the front and back of your torso are “kill locations.” If you become confused about exactly where one location stops and another begins, thinking of a Barbie™ doll may help. The buttocks of a person are considered leg shots. If you are hit in the buttock(s), you lose the appropriate leg(s).</p>
<h3 id="killing-blows">Killing Blows</h3>
<p>If you are struck in a kill location your PC is dead (see <a href="#character-death">Section 3.4: Character Death</a> and <a href="#scalping">Section 3.5: Scalping</a> for more details).</p>
<p>If you are hit on the top of the shoulder, your PC is dead. If you are wearing armor, a blow to the top of the shoulder is considered a blow to the front or back depending on whether your opponent is in front of you or behind you.</p>
<h3 id="limb-shots">Limb Shots</h3>
<p>If you are struck in a limb, your PC loses the use of that entire limb. If you are struck in a limb that has already been lost, and that limb blocked what could have possibly been a legal shot to another location, then that location should be considered hit. You cannot protect the side of your PC’s body with a disabled arm or by lifting a disabled leg up to block. Once your PC’s limb has been disabled, it should be put behind you. This keeps it out of the way as well as provides a visual cue to other players that your PC is hurt. Once you have lost a limb, your PC cannot use that limb at all. Don’t limp on a damaged leg.</p>
<h3 id="hand-on-weapon">Hand-on-Weapon</h3>
<p>If you are struck on a hand that is holding anything that is legal to block or parry with (weapons and shields, but not bows, javelins or arrows), it is considered gauntleted and immune to damage. When this happens, call out “Hand” or “Hand-on-weapon.” If you are struck on a hand that is not holding anything you can parry with, even if you have just taken it off for a second, it is considered a legal limb shot and your PC has to suffer the consequences. Your hand is considered everything below the wrist bone.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-take-multiple-hits">How to Take Multiple Hits</h3>
<p>Should an opponent’s weapon (be it a melee weapon, missile weapon, or spell prop) hit you in more than one location with the same swing, all points of contact count as hits.</p>
<h2 id="combat-etiquette">3.2: Combat Etiquette</h2>
<p>Combat is an important part of the game. In order to make the game more fun for everyone, combat etiquette, which is OOC, has been developed. Using combat etiquette helps avoid confusion and promotes the same kind of behavior when someone else is fighting you.</p>
<h3 id="calling-hits">Calling Hits</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility to call where you were hit in combat. This is to let the other participant(s) and the marshals know that you were hit, and where you were hit. Calling armor, protections, and other effects is also your responsibility. Armor must always be called, even when a PC is dead. It is not acceptable to call another player’s hits for them. If you feel that another participant is consistently miscalling their hits, missing shots, or some other form of cheating, please alert a marshal. It is acceptable to ask your opponent if they were hit, calling their attention to the location.</p>
<h3 id="late-shots">Late Shots</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will strike another participant immediately after receiving a hit that injures or kills your PC. For example, just before your sword makes contact with an opponent, your attacking arm is struck by another weapon. Even though you are incapable of physically halting your attack, the injury your PC received renders the hit ineffective. There is no “follow through” effect that allows your attack to be successful. This is called a late shot. If you deliver a late shot, it is your responsibility to inform your opponent to not take the blow. Common phrasing includes “Don’t take that!” or “Late, on your arm!” Like other shots, you may not declare that someone else hit you late. If you think someone is failing to call their late shots, question them after combat ends, or bring your concern to a marshal.</p>
<h3 id="illegal-hits">Illegal Hits</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may hit someone with a part of your weapon that doesn’t actually damage their PC, such as the pipe of a weapon, the side of a thrust-only weapon (see <a href="#weapon-rules">Section 3.7: Weapon Rules</a>), or the shaft, fletching or nock of an arrow or javelin. If you do this, be sure to call “Don’t take that!” to alert them that it wasn’t a legal hit, and that they may resume play as if the hit never occurred. A player may also call “shaft” if they received an illegal hit from an arrow or javelin, or call “slash” if they received an illegal hit from a thrust-only weapon.</p>
<h3 id="missing-shots">Missing Shots</h3>
<p>Sometimes in the thick of battle people miss shots, because of adrenaline or focus. This is generally unintentional and accidental. It often stops once a fighter has more experience in calling and feeling their shots. Repeatedly missing shots or intentionally missing shots is different and is cheating. If you repeatedly miss shots, you may be asked to get retrained in fighting, or may be asked to stop playing.</p>
<h3 id="off-target-areas">Off-Target Areas</h3>
<p>Your face and the front of your throat are off-target; players should never aim attacks there. If you are hit in either location, you should announce it even though the hit has no game effect. Face is considered the area on your head below your eyebrows, in front of your ears. Throat is considered the forward-facing section of your neck, above the sternum. The forehead from the eyebrows up, the back and top of your head, and the sides and back of your neck are all legal targets.</p>
<p>Should an opponent’s weapon hit you in more than one location with the same swing and one or more of those blows land in an off-target area (such as your face or your throat), you still have to accept those blows which did land in legal locations.</p>
<p>Breast shots and groin shots are legal and considered killing shots, but such shots are highly discouraged. Everyone is encouraged to wear protective gear to avoid injury to sensitive areas.</p>
<p>You should never deliberately aim for an off-target area (face with any weapon, or head with a ranged weapon) or the groin or breasts. Accidents happen, but if you frequently target these sensitive areas it will indicate to others that you are not a safe and controlled fighter, and you may be asked to sit out by a marshal.</p>
<h2 id="armor">3.3: Armor</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-armor">Types of Armor</h3>
<p>Your PC may be able to wear armor. Armor allows a PC to take blows without taking injuries. There are two kinds of armor: heavy and light. Heavy armor will absorb two blows per hit location before you have to take the shot. Light armor will absorb one blow per hit location.</p>
<p>Light armor is a thin, pliable kind of armor. Light armor can be made out of multiple layers of quilting or a moderate weight of leather. A quilted cloth jerkin or a thin leather helmet are examples of 1-point armor. Garment-weight leather (such as suede pants or moccasins) is not suitable for light armor.</p>
<p>Heavy armor is in general bulkier, rigid, and more cumbersome than light armor. Hard-boiled leather, heavy-weight leather, studded leather/cloth, brigandine, and chainmail/platemail are classic examples of 2-point armor. Any armor that is studded must have at least one metallic component every square inch to count as heavy armor.</p>
<p>Armor must allow you to feel blows through it and it must look like it would fit in a medieval or fantasy setting.</p>
<h3 id="calling-your-armor">Calling Your Armor</h3>
<p>Armor protects by hit location, so if you have more than one piece of armor on a hit location, it is all considered damaged when you are struck there. On the other hand, if one piece of armor covers more than one hit location, it is treated as separate hit locations. The armor hit locations are divided up by the hit locations for taking wounds and kills. Light armor allows you to call out “Armor 1” on that hit location and the next blow will do damage. If you are wearing heavy armor you should call out “Armor 1” then “Armor 2” before the hit location takes damage.</p>
<p>You can be wearing armor on a hit location yet still have some areas of that hit location that are not covered. These sections are also considered armored if at least 75% of the entire hit location is covered by armor. If some of that armor is light and some is heavy then the uncovered areas can only call out “Armor 1”. If all of the armor on the hit location is heavy then then the uncovered areas can call both points of armor. A marshal should be asked to rule whether or not 75% of the location is covered in any case where it is ambiguous.</p>
<p>For example, if you are wearing a thin leather upper-arm bracer and a metal lower-arm bracer on your right arm, only a leather upper-arm bracer on your left arm, and a chainmail shirt that goes down to your knees: a shot to anywhere on your lower-left arm disables your PC’s left arm. The upper bracer was not struck and thus has no benefit. A shot to the upper portion of your left arm damages the upper-arm bracer. Your PC still has the limb, but the armor on that limb is gone. A shot to the lower-right arm bracer damages all the arm armor. You still have a point of armor left on the lower bracer, but if you are hit on the upper-right arm bracer, your PC will lose the limb. Had the next shot also hit the right lower-arm bracer, all the right arm armor would be gone. Three shots to a leg covered by the chainmail skirt would destroy all of the armor on that leg and disable the PC’s leg as well. Even though the armor protecting the leg and the armor protecting the torso is all one piece, you can still take two shots to the armor on your front torso, back torso, and your other leg before the armor in those locations is completely destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="character-death">3.4 Character Death</h2>
<p>As players experience the game through the eyes of their characters, PC death becomes an important aspect of the game.</p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>Death occurs in many ways. Usually, death of a character happens when something, such as a weapon, hits a character in an unarmored kill location. Certain spells may also kill a character, from magic missiles to ingesting poisons or other more esoteric means. Death renders the character incapable of any action until such time as a spellcaster or item, with the power to heal the dead, raises the character, or magic that regenerates or animates them takes effect.</p>
<p>Death can be repaired by many spells, abilities, and items. Be sure to go over <a href="#combat-in-the-realms">Part 3: Combat in the Realms</a> and <a href="#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know">Section 6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone Should Know</a> for more details on what causes and cures death.</p>
<p>In the Realms there are two states of death. They are death (or dead), and scalped (see <a href="#scalping">Section 3.5</a> for more information on Scalping).</p>
<p>If your PC is dead or scalped, you should lie or sit still. Try not to look around or talk. Do your best to role-play a corpse. Don’t get upset if someone hits you with a killing blow when you are already dead. If somebody does this just say, “Dead.” They are making sure that you really are dead.</p>
<p>In tournaments, or other high combat situations, it is acceptable for a character to move out of the way to avoid being stepped on. They may resume their death act in a safer place. They may also sit or kneel to avoid injuries. If you are role-playing death in any of these forms, you should put your weapon over your head to signify your character is dead.</p>
<p>If someone looks at you and asks you to describe your wounds, do your best to comply. If you were backstabbed and you’re lying on your back, tell them they don’t see any wounds. Then, if they roll you over to look at your back, tell them they see a deep wound in your back.</p>
<p>When your PC is killed (dead, but not scalped) and then raised, they may remember everything up until the point of their death.</p>
<h3 id="playing-dead">Playing Dead</h3>
<p>It is legal for characters to lie down and pretend they are dead, but they may not put their weapons over their head. If someone asks a player if their character is dead, the player and the character are not obligated to answer, but if a player is asked to describe their character’s wounds, they should do so as accurately and honestly as possible. If their character is not really dead and someone comes close to them to loot their character’s body, they are free to attack the unsuspecting looters. If you are unsure as to whether someone’s character is dead and want the character to be, tap the player gently in a kill location.</p>
<h2 id="scalping">3.5: Scalping</h2>
<p>Scalping is the removal of a character’s life essence through mutilation of the body. It is a more serious form of death that requires more than a simple spell to repair. Scalped characters cannot be raised or animated until their soul has been restored.</p>
<h3 id="scalps">Scalps</h3>
<p>A scalp is a token carried by each player, which represents the life essence of that player’s character. Players must be carrying their PC’s scalp at all times; unless the PC is dead and scalped (see below), or unless they are under the influence of a spell which removes the PC’s scalp. Scalps must have their player’s name and the PC’s name written legibly on it. A scalp does not exist physically in the IC world therefore it cannot be searched. A scalp is a non-magical and non-stealable marshaling tool.</p>
<h3 id="how-characters-are-scalped">How Characters are Scalped</h3>
<p>In order to scalp a body, you must strike 200 blows with a weapon beside the body of the character being scalped. More than one person may scalp a body at a time. More than one weapon may be used to scalp a body as well. This effectively divides the number of blows to be struck between the number of participants and number of weapons used. Some monsters and characters under certain spells may require more scalping blows to completely destroy. If you strike 200 blows and the victim says “The job is not yet done,” then the scalping is not yet complete. Some spells, such as <a href="#strange-brew">Strange Brew: Potion of Acid</a> and <a href="#assassins-blade">Assassin’s Blade</a>, may accelerate the act of scalping.</p>
<p>After the scalping is finished, the player of the scalped character must present their character’s scalp to the character that just scalped them. It is then that player’s responsibility to present the scalp to an EH or an appointed marshal. The EH must be informed immediately of the scalping, thus allowing the EH time to prepare for those who might wish to return the scalped character to life.</p>
<p>Characters that are pretending to be dead should interpret any scalping blows as blows to the closest kill location. So, if your PC is pretending to be dead and someone starts to scalp them, the first blows that are struck on the ground next to you should be played as if they were striking your PC on the nearest kill location, destroying any undamaged armor, and then killing them.</p>
<p>If your PC is killed and scalped, they will not remember anything about how they died should they manage to be raised.</p>
<p>Should your PC be dead at the end of an event without being raised, even if the character was not actively scalped, the PC will be considered scalped.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-a-scalped-character">Fixing a Scalped Character</h3>
<p>To restore someone to life after scalping, characters must first have the body of the person needing to be raised. Then characters must either cast a <a href="#call-the-soul">Call the Soul</a>, an <a href="#intervention">Intervention</a> spell, or administer a Potion of Soul Snare (see <a href="#strange-brew">Strange Brew</a>) to summon and reattach the scalp. If characters lack the body, only an <a href="#intervention">Intervention</a> spell will be able to return the scalped PC back to life. When the body and scalp are reunited, characters must cast one <a href="#raise-dead">Raise Dead</a> spell for each event (including the first) since the scalped PC was scalped in order to raise them. A different spellcaster must provide each <a href="#raise-dead">Raise Dead</a> spell used for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-death">3.6: Permanent Death</h2>
<p>When a PC is dead and scalped at the end of an event at which they were at some point alive, they get a “tick.” PCs may also receive ticks due to use of certain magic items or plot interactions. A PC is only obligated to accept one involuntary tick per event. A PC that accumulates three or more ticks is permanently dead, as their soul can no longer be restored by any means. On January 1st of each new year, one tick is removed from each PC that has any, unless they are already permanently dead. If a PC is killed and scalped during an event, but returned to life before the end of the event, they do not get a tick.</p>
<p>For a scalping to be official, it must be brought to the EH’s attention. The EH must provide the Death Marshal with this scalping information from their events. A tick may only be issued or reported by a legal EH of the event where the tick was incurred or by the player whose PC received the tick. The Death Marshal will keep track of this information. The current Death Marshal is Keith Cronyn who can be reached at <a href="mailto:Keith.Cronyn@gmail.com">Keith.Cronyn@gmail.com</a> or at 603-819-8689.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-rules">3.7: Weapon Rules</h2>
<p>Players are responsible for being safe with the weapon(s) they are using. Before using a weapon style in-game, players should take it upon themselves to be properly trained by a marshal or someone who is safe and proficient with that weapon style.</p>
<h3 id="wielding-weapons">Wielding Weapons</h3>
<p>For the purposes of the rules, you are wielding a weapon or shield if you are holding it in your hand(s) and you attack, parry, or block with it. You are wielding a combination of weapons and/or a shield if you attack, parry, or block with either of them. Simply holding a weapon, or menacing with it, does not count as wielding unless contact is made. You cannot wield more than one item in a hand at once.</p>
<p>If you are wielding an illegal weapon or combination and you attack, then you should tell the target “Don’t take that.” If something you are not wielding blocks a shot, then you should treat the blow as if it had landed. If you are not sure where that blow would have landed, then assume it would hit the location that would cause you the most harm (e.g., an unarmored kill location). There are special restrictions for spellcasters in terms of wielding and blocking with different weapons, and specific consequences for doing so outside of the spellcaster’s restriction. See <a href="#breaking-weapon-restrictions">Breaking Weapon Restrictions</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The size of a weapon dictates how it may be wielded. Weapons cannot be any smaller than 12“, and cannot exceed 8’ in length.</p>

<h3 id="one-handed-weapons">One-Handed Weapons</h3>
<p>You can wield a one-handed weapon or shield in one hand and still use another one-handed weapon or shield in the other hand. Using two one-handed weapons (up to 3’8&quot; each) together, one in each hand, is commonly called a “Florentine” combination. Magic Missiles are also considered one-handed weapons, but follow special rules (see <a href="#magic-missile">Magic Missile</a>, under Spell Descriptions).</p>
<h3 id="hand-and-a-half-weapons">Hand-and-a-Half Weapons</h3>
<p>If a weapon is considered hand-and-a-half, then you can use the weapon with one hand, but your other arm or hand cannot be holding a weapon or a shield. Lightning bolts are also considered hand-and-a-half weapons. Bows are wielded as hand-and-a-half weapons, but follow special rules (see <a href="#bows">Bows</a> below).</p>
<h3 id="two-handed-weapons">Two-Handed Weapons</h3>
<p>If a weapon is two-handed, you may only wield the weapon with two hands. Every blow you strike must be started with two hands. If you lose an arm while wielding a two-handed weapon, you may not attack with that weapon. You may parry with a two-handed weapon with only one hand, but only if you are not wielding something else with your other hand.</p>
<p>Every blow you strike with a two-handed weapon must begin with both hands on the weapon. If you let go with one hand during the swing, the swing is still legal. Once the initial swing has ended, the attacker will have to grab the weapon with two hands again before making another attack.</p>
<h3 id="thrust-only-weapons">Thrust-Only Weapons</h3>
<p>Thrust-only weapons cannot strike an opponent with a “slashing” or side-to-side motion. If you slash at an opponent with a thrust-only weapon, you must tell them “Don’t take that.” As long as the tip of the weapon strikes with a forward motion the blow must be taken. If you are not certain that a thrust-only strike landed properly, you must assume it was a slash and tell your opponent not to take the shot.</p>
<h3 id="spears-thrust-only">Spears (Thrust-only)</h3>
<p>A spear is a thrust-only weapon between 4’ and 5’ in length. These weapons may be used as a single-handed weapon if used alone or with a shield. Spears may not be used with other weapons. Their length must be between 1/3 to 1/2 covered in foam and they must be clearly labeled with the word “Spear” on the blade. Once being labeled as a spear the weapon must stay thrust-only even if it is legally made to regular slashing hand-and-a-half standards.</p>
<h3 id="bows">Bows</h3>
<p>A bow is wielded as if it were a hand-and-a-half weapon. This means that it may not be held when a weapon or shield is being wielded in your other hand, but it is legal to fire it with one hand— if you can! A bow is not considered a “weapon” for purposes of determining whether a spell fails; arrows are considered weapons and will cause some spells to fail.</p>
<p>Bows must have a draw-weight of 30 pounds or less. Just like melee weapons, you should be careful on how hard your arrows are striking your opponent. Arrows should be drawn with the minimal pull necessary to score a successful hit.</p>
<p>If a weapon hits a wielded bow or nocked arrow, the bow is “broken” and may no longer be used in combat. Anyone can fix a broken bow by holding the bow with both hands, then counting to 200 seconds. You cannot actively parry with a bow or an arrow.</p>
<h3 id="javelins">Javelins</h3>
<p>A javelin is wielded as if it were a single-handed weapon. This means that it may be held when a weapon or shield is being wielded in your other hand. A javelin is considered a weapon for the purposes of spells.</p>
<h3 id="missile-weapons">Missile Weapons</h3>
<p>Projectile weapons such as arrows, crossbow bolts, spells (like Magic Missile), and javelins cannot be targeted at your opponent’s head. Head shots from projectile weapons, even if they did not hit the face or the throat, do not have to be taken as legal shots.</p>
<p>Being struck with any portion of the foam head of the arrow or javelin will cause damage. The shaft, fletching, and nocks of arrows and javelins do not cause damage.</p>
<p>All projectile weapons, with the exception of arrows and javelins, are live and inflict damage on any target they hit until they come to rest, regardless of whether they hit the ground, a wall, a weapon, a tree, or any other obstacle along the way. In the case of arrows and javelins, an arrow or javelin is considered live and is able to inflict damage until it comes into contact with the ground. If an arrow or javelin hits you after it comes into contact with the ground it does no damage. It is the responsibility of the player wielding the bow or javelin to tell you not to take the blow. A player may also call “shaft” if they received an illegal hit from an arrow or javelin.The length of javelins and arrows are not subject to a spellcaster’s weapon restriction.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-construction">3.8: Weapons Construction</h2>
<p>There are several ways to make weapons in the Realms. If you are playing for the first time, it might be a better idea to borrow weapons than try to make any of your own. Once you have seen what other weapons have looked like and asked a few questions on how others have made their weapons, then you will be better prepared to construct your own.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow these guidelines when constructing a weapon: * All non-missile melee weapons must be made out of lightwall PVC, fiberglass, or bamboo cores as noted in the table below. There can be nothing in the core. Both ends must be capped with a rigid material. * All weapons must have a thrusting tip (the pipe foam that extends beyond the tip of the pipe) as noted below. * A weapon’s striking surface must be made from closed-celled foam pipe insulation, which must be at least 5/8&quot; thick and which must be firmly strapping-taped in place. All striking surfaces must be covered in either duct tape or fabric. Only magic weapons should be made with a blue-colored striking surface, and you may only make a magic weapon through the use of spells in the magic system, or if you are releasing one as an EH.</p>

<li>All shields must have their edges covered by foam. Any protruding metal screws or bolts should also be padded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="equipment-inspections">3.10: Equipment Inspections</h2>
<p>You must inspect any armor, weapon, or shield before using it. If you are unsure about an item’s safety, ask a marshal and they will inspect it for you. Any item can be inspected at any time during an event at anyone’s request. This is meant for the purpose of ensuring safety and should never be used for strategic or tactical purposes. The EH or a designated marshal retains final ruling on the approval for use of any armor, weapon, or shield.</p>
<h3 id="armor-inspection">Armor Inspection</h3>
<p>Armor can be failed or the point value of armor may be adjusted for many reasons. Armor can have exposed edges that could cause a safety concern for the wearer or other combatants. The EH or designated marshal retains final ruling on the point value and approval for use of armor.</p>
<h3 id="shield-inspection">Shield Inspection</h3>
<p>Shields can be failed for many reasons. A shield can have exposed edges or protrusions that could cause a safety concern for the wearer or other combatants. A shield can be failed if it has seen too much abuse and has not been repaired recently. The EH or designated marshal retains final ruling on the approval for use of a shield.</p>
<h3 id="weapon-inspection-1">Weapon Inspection</h3>
<p>Weapons can be failed for many reasons. A weapon can have too much “whip” (one that flexes too much) or not enough “whip” (one that doesn’t flex at all). There is no standard way of measuring flex, you will have to use your common sense. A weapon can be failed if it has seen too much abuse and has not been repaired recently. The most common problem weapons have is that their thrusting tips are breaking down or have been compacted. The EH or marshal retains final ruling on the approval for use of a weapon.</p>
<h2 id="combat-calls">3.11: Combat Calls</h2>
<p>Combat calls are what you may hear yelled in combat, and you must know how these calls affect your PC.</p>
<h3 id="armor-1">Armor</h3>
<p>Negates a hit attack. When “Armor” (or “Armor 1,” “Armor 2,” or “Armored Cloak”) is called in combat, it means that the person calling armor is protected against the attack that landed on them, usually by means of armor or a spell effect.</p>
<h3 id="armor-piercing">Armor-Piercing</h3>
<p>Armor cannot always protect a PC from certain attacks. If an opponent attacks a PC in any way and calls out “Armor-Piercing,” any of the armor that is struck by the attack is completely destroyed, and the PC suffers the effect of the blow as if they were not wearing armor. For example, if a PC is wearing heavy armor on their right arm, and an opponent hits it while calling “Armor-Piercing,” the PC’s armor is destroyed on that arm and they lose the limb.</p>
<h3 id="boulder">Boulder</h3>
<p>A PC can encounter a boulder call in one of two ways: being hit with a physical boulder prop or by a weapon simulating the effects of a boulder. In either instance, the same call of “Boulder!” is used.</p>
<p>If you or any of your equipment are hit by the call of “Boulder!”, you suffer the following effects: your character is dead, any armor hit is “broken” where the boulder touched the locations, magic items hit by the boulder are disenchanted, and any non-monetary equipment (i.e. non-enchanted weapons, bows, and shields) that is hit by the boulder is “broken.” It is the player’s responsibility to see that items damaged this way are not used until the appropriate repair spells are cast upon them.</p>
<p>A boulder prop is often represented by throwing large duct-taped chunks of foam or beanbag chairs with the zippers duct-taped over. When thrown, the boulder is active until it comes completely to rest. PCs may not throw or pick up boulders. Four or more PCs, using a total of eight hands on the boulder, may work together to “push” a boulder along, to free trapped gear and companions, but not to cause damage.</p>
<h3 id="disease">Disease</h3>
<p>If a weapon strikes a PC and the wielder calls “Disease,” wounds on their body take twice as many spells to be healed until the disease is cured. This effect only damages a PC, not their armor. For example, if you are hit by a diseased blow to the leg, <a href="#heal-limb">Heal Limb</a> would need to be cast twice on the leg for it to be healed until the disease is cured. Similarly, if you are killed by a disease shot, the spell <a href="#raise-dead">Raise Dead</a> will need to be cast twice on you until you are cured of the disease.</p>
<p>Regeneration effects will still affect a diseased character with a single use, but the regeneration time is doubled until the disease is cured. Disease can affect both living and dead characters.</p>
<h3 id="fireball">Fireball</h3>
<p>If you or any of your equipment are hit by the call of fireball, your character is dead. Armor and weapons hit by the fireball are not broken, but also do not protect against its damage.</p>
<p>The fireball call may come in the form of a thrown prop (as with a magic missile) or as a weapon blow. Fireball is magical in nature.</p>
<h3 id="flat">Flat</h3>
<p>To “knock out” an opponent, the attacking player must call out the word “Flat” prior to their attack. Should a successful killing blow be struck, they have instead rendered their foe unconscious for a steady count of 300 seconds. The unconscious PC may be wakened sooner by having another PC come and wake them up by touching the unconscious PC and saying “Wake Up.” The PC can also wake up when any damage is inflicted on them. You may call “Flat” at any time, even in the middle of a fight. This form of attack deals no damage to armor.</p>
<h3 id="impale">Impale</h3>
<p>Impaling is the act of holding a weapon in an opponent’s kill location after death, and saying the word “Impale.” It counts as continuous, non-scalping blows to that location. The act of impaling will bypass any armor, damaged or not. While impaled, a character cannot be raised or animated and is unable to regenerate. The results can vary when impaling NPCs.</p>
<h3 id="lightning-bolt-call">Lightning Bolt</h3>
<p>If you are hit by any part of a white boff arrow and the thrower calls “Lightning Bolt,” your PC is struck as if by a magic armor-piercing weapon (see the <a href="#magic-call">Magic</a> and <a href="#armor-piercing">Armor-Piercing</a> calls in this section).</p>
<h3 id="poison">Poison</h3>
<p>There may be occasions where a PC is struck with a blow and the wielder calls “Poison.” If this strike damages a PC in any location, be it torso, arm, leg, etc., then the PC is killed. When the blow does no damage to a PC, such as a hit to an off-target area or a hit to armor that protects the PC, then the poison has no effect. Armor struck with a poison blow is still used. If a PC is under the effects of a spell that protects them from poison in some fashion, the PC still takes the normal damage from the blow but the poison will have no additional effect. Players should also call “Immunity to Poison,” to allow an opponent to understand that you recognized that the blow was poisoned.</p>
<h3 id="weapon-type-and-material-calls">Weapon Type and Material Calls</h3>
<p>Occasionally, more powerful monsters are only affected by certain weapon types or by certain materials. For example, axe-mace trolls are typically only injured by axes and maces; werewolves are only affected by weapons made of silver. It might be a good habit when using a melee weapon other than a sword, to call the type of weapon you are using as you swing. If using a mace, say “Mace” with each swing. When you are wielding a non-normal weapon (e.g., magic or silver), that weapon will always strike with the same effect therefore you must call that effect with every swing.</p>
<h3 id="magic-call">Magic</h3>
<p>If a weapon strikes you and the wielder calls “Magic” (or “Magic Missile”), it means your PC has been hit with a magical blow. Generally, being hit by magic doesn’t affect your PC any differently than being hit by a normal weapon, but sometimes PCs are under spell effects where it makes a difference.</p>
<h3 id="silver">Silver</h3>
<p>If a weapon strikes you and the wielder calls “Silver” it means your PC has been hit with a silver blow. Being hit by silver doesn’t affect your PC any differently than being hit by a normal weapon.</p>
<h1 id="non-combat-interactions">4: Non-Combat Interactions</h1>
<h2 id="in-character-and-out-of-character">4.1: In-Character and Out-of-Character</h2>
<h3 id="being-in-character">Being In-Character</h3>
<p>Generally, events officially begin after the safety rules, any specific site rules, and other special event rules have been read aloud to the gathered players.</p>
<p>Once an event has begun, you are expected to be in-character (IC) at all times. This means that you are playing your PC the whole time you are at an event. Staying IC can add greatly not only to your own event experience, but to those who are playing the game around you. When a companion of your PC is “killed” it adds to the tension and drama of the scene if they pretend they are dead, but it breaks the mood completely if they are laughing and making comments.</p>
<p>Your character may feel differently than you do about something, like slavery, magic, politics, or religion. You may be a pacifist, while your character is a bloodthirsty barbarian. If you can remain true to the character, despite your differences, you can make a memorable story for yourself and those around you. Sometimes staying IC is challenging, especially when you know something that your character shouldn’t logically know, but you should try to remain IC when playing. Likewise, when the game is done, leave your character behind.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-character">Breaking Character</h3>
<p>Once an event has begun, breaking character should be done only when necessary. If you must do so, what you say should be prefaced with “Out-of-character,” as in “Out-of-character, where is the tenting area?” That way, the person you are addressing knows that it is a real-world concern, and should be dealt wit differently than a strictly IC concern.</p>
<p>Sometimes when players get really into character, you may begin to wonder whether animosity or other emotions are completely IC. It is acceptable to break character to make sure everything is in fact still IC and no one’s feelings are getting hurt OOC.</p>
<h3 id="out-of-character-only-terms">Out-of-Character-Only Terms</h3>
<p>There are a few terms that should only be used when speaking OOC: “Hold” and “Medic.” Hold is only used in emergencies as it stops the game. Read <a href="#the-safety-rules">Section 2.3: The Safety Rules</a> for more information on the correct use of the word Hold. Medic is used when someone needs immediate real-world medical attention for any reason: an allergic reaction to a bee-sting, a twisted ankle, an asthma attack, etc. Do not call “Medic” for imaginary (IC) injuries. If you need IC medical attention, call “Healer!”</p>
<h3 id="out-of-play-areas-and-time-out">Out-of-Play Areas and Time-Out</h3>
<p>The EH has the option of declaring portions of the event site as “out-of-play” for safety reasons or for NPC use. Never use these out-of-play areas as safe havens.</p>
<p>If a fight breaks out in an area that is unsafe to fight in or that is out-of-play, then the fight should be moved to a safe in-play area. If you are in such an area, you may be asked to leave said area for combat. If you refuse to leave the unsafe area, your PC is considered dead. After the fight, those involved can move back to where the fight “really” took place, and continue on.</p>
<p>An EH is free to create an in-game safe area if they choose. For example, powerful enchantments on the tavern may render weapons and hostile magic inoperable within the tavern walls. In this case, it is fine for players to hide there, since they will be taking advantage of an in-game effect.</p>
<p>EHs may also declare a time-out during an event for sleep, dinner, etc. While on an event site, if you are not acting as an NPC at the EH’s request, or you are not in a time-out, a character is liable to be attacked, and their possessions open to theft.</p>
<h2 id="dragging">4.2: Dragging</h2>
<p>To drag a dead, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated body in our game, you must place a hand on the shoulder, back, or arm of the body and say “Drag.” The player being dragged must then get up and walk with you, bringing what they are carrying with them. Stealable items stay on a dragged corpse unless explicitly searched off. A dragged body is considered one-handed and may not be used as a weapon or a shield. At any time you may tell the dragged player “Drop,” thereby letting go of the player and dropping them on the ground. A body being dragged can never be “thrown” or “tossed.” If the person dragging the body lets go, then the body should drop in place.</p>
<h2 id="searching-and-theft">4.3: Searching and Theft</h2>
<p>There are certain items that are referred to as being “Stealable.” Some examples of stealable items are magic items, magic weapons, Realms currency, silver weapons, and occasionally non-magical items. With the exception of currency, the word “Stealable” is likely written somewhere on the object.</p>
<p>Players must assume that any props or items used by event staff are not stealable unless labeled as such or told otherwise by event staff.</p>
<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>
<p>Searching is a touchy subject. In the real world, if a bandit has just killed someone they can just take everything they own. In the Realms, an object has to be considered stealable to be taken from a person or location without the owner’s permission. The problem is that often these stealable items are not easily recognizable, especially the smaller items. Also, while “secret pockets” and such seem like a good idea at first, frisking a dead character could be considered a form of harassment towards the player and should be avoided. To handle this situation, the searching rule exists.</p>
<p>The searching rule is verbose because there have been a lot of problems about searching in the past. The rule is mostly common sense. Once you think about it, it will seem quite simple. There are two ways you can search someone, using a Point Search or Full Search.</p>
<h3 id="point-search">Point Search</h3>
<p>To simulate ransacking a character’s pouches, weapons, and clothing quickly, a player can “point search.” Essentially, the searcher says “Search” and tells the victim where they are searching (e.g., “I search your pouch.”) If there are stealable items in the area being searched, then all the items in that area are handed over immediately. The area that a person point-searches cannot be any larger than one hit location on the body (e.g., you would have to search each sleeve of a shirt and the front and back of a shirt to search everywhere inside the shirt). Pockets and pouches have to be pointed out to be searched. You cannot say “I’m searching all your pockets,” you have to search each one individually; left and right sleeves, boots, gloves, etc., all have to be searched separately, one at a time. Only one person can point search a victim at a time. Point searching does not wake up an unconscious character.</p>
<h3 id="full-search">Full Search</h3>
<p>The other way to search someone is to simulate taking your time to do it thoroughly. That is, the character simulates stripping the body from head to toe, ripping everything to shreds, garnering every last item you own, etc. In order to do this the searcher simply says “Full search.” Every stealable item the victim has must be handed over to the searcher. The characters should take 120 seconds to do this. If so, then the items should be considered the IC possessions of the searching character. Full searching will wake up an unconscious character.</p>
<p>If someone full-searches a character and a different character comes by during that time and point-searches the victim, the full search is stopped and the point search is resolved. If a character does not specify what kind of search they are performing, then it is assumed that they are performing a point search. If told only that they are being searched, the player whose character is being searched must assume it is a point search and respond, “Where?”</p>
<h3 id="realms-thieves">Realms Thieves</h3>
<p>The only objects that are always in-play, are fair game for theft, and can be stolen without consulting the bearer of the object, are those considered stealable in-game (see <a href="#in-game-items">Section 4.4: In-Game Items</a>, below). In order to steal any other object, you must have the explicit permission of the owner/bearer before making the theft. This means that to steal another PC’s jewelry (assuming that some of it is considered treasure), you must ask the person who plays that PC. One way to do this is to kill or flat the character and tell them that you are searching them. If they have anything that is in-play, they must show it to you, for you to take or leave as you wish. You should never pick up something off a table or from in front of someone’s tent, unless it is a magic or silver weapon, or Realms currency.</p>
<p>It should be restated that people’s tents, bags, packs, and pouches are completely off-limits and out-of-play. No matter how many magic or silver weapons, or how much Realms currency someone might have, you may never, under any circumstances, enter their tent or go into their bags, packs, or pouches and take anything out without the owner’s explicit permission.</p>
<p>A magic item is the property of the EH that created it. It is the EH’s will that the item be able to be circulated around the Realms by theft, as a gift, as part of an inheritance, or any other means so long as it occurs at an event.</p>
<p>IC theft, not gift, of stealable items in OOC situations, not at an event, is not acceptable and will not be upheld.</p>
<h2 id="in-game-items">4.4: In-Game Items</h2>
<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>
<p>Various groups and nations issue different currencies for use as treasure and to pay for goods and services in-game. These currencies are often represented by stamped metal disks or roofing tins, sometimes bearing printed stickers for identification or are minted in metals, plastic or even clay. In-game these currencies usually represent Gold or Silver. Denominations vary from currency to currency. Generally ten silver pieces are worth one gold piece. The more prized issues are backed, meaning that if you accumulate enough of any one currency, you can trade those coins in to the issuer for goods, weapons, or services. Many older coinages and silver pieces are not backed, and while they’re still in-play, many people either heavily discount them or don’t accept them at all. Issues and worth of coins fluctuate. If you’re in doubt as to what a coin is worth, ask the merchants and the gamblers. Realms currency cannot be counterfeited; to do so is cheating.</p>
<h3 id="silver-weapons">Silver Weapons</h3>
<p>Silver weapons are created by players with the spell <a href="#reforge">Reforge</a> or are released by EHs.</p>
<h3 id="magic-items-and-magic-weapons">Magic Items and Magic Weapons</h3>
<p>All magic items and magic weapons are stealable.</p>
<p>Magic weapons must be made with a blue-colored striking surface, so that they are distinctive. No permanent magic item may be issued by anyone except an EH (see <a href="#realms-administration">Section 7: Realms Administration</a> for more information).</p>
<p>Should a magic item or weapon become broken or disenchanted at an event, it requires a repair through the <a href="#reforge">Reforge</a> spell to return to a functioning state. Additionally, magic items which have been revoked by their EH/creator are no longer considered magic items and also revert back to the EH who created them. Magic weapons that are currently in existence may be re-bladed without the use of a <a href="#reforge">Reforge</a> spell, to repair safety issues, by first contacting and gaining permission from the issuing or backing EH.</p>
<h3 id="event-stealable">Event-Stealable</h3>
<p>The props for certain spells and items as designated by the EH are considered “Event-Stealable,” meaning that they are stealable treasure during an event, but should be returned to their OOC owner when you leave an event. Before you leave an event site, you must return (to the best of your ability) any items marked as “Event-Stealable” to the EH or MM. Props for PC spells are returned by the EH or MM as an OOC courtesy, and will be done so without revealing the identity of the thief. If you have a spell that has an event-stealable prop as a component, you may replace it without penalty at the next event if it is not returned to you for whatever reason. You can never declare permanently stealable items as event-stealable.</p>
<h1 id="character-creation">5: Character Creation</h1>
<h2 id="the-social-structure">5.1: The Social Structure</h2>
<p>The Realms is not governed by a single kingdom. Each nation has its own hierarchy and structure. There are no hard rules for governing the social structure. Claiming land and titles is anyone’s prerogative. The social structure really only has one rule: if you can back up your title or claim then you deserve to hold it. If you can’t, then you should have nothing to complain about if you get put in your place.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-character">5.2: Creating a Character</h2>
<p>If you are already familiar with role-playing in general, or with live action role-playing specifically, you probably already know how to make a character. If you are new to the concept of role-playing, the following questions might help you establish the traits and characteristics of your PC. You should try to answer the questions for yourself, but some suggestions are provided.</p>
<p><em>What is your character’s species?</em> There are as many species available in the Realms as there are minds to create them. In the Realms, there are no restrictions on what species you can play. The only rule is that you may gain no special benefits or specialized abilities for playing a certain race or person (the only way to gain supernatural powers is through legally released items, the spell system, or by being appointed a <em>Knight of the Realms</em> or a <em>Knight of the Eternal Flame</em>). If you create your own “race,” you would do well to consider its mannerisms, average age, codes of ethic, etc. Of course humans are the easiest to play, since you are probably human.</p>
<p><em>What is your character’s age?</em> If you are playing a human character, it is usually best to pick an age near your own. Other species may have different average ages.</p>
<p><em>Why is your character an adventurer?</em> Most people of the Realms prefer the relatively safe life of a farmer or craftsman. Why has your character left home to join in the rather hazardous occupation of hero? The answer to this might give you some valuable insight into the persona of your character.</p>
<p><em>What is your character’s background?</em> There is no limit on where your character came from. As was stated before, your character can come from anywhere, so long as they gain no IC benefits from it.</p>
<p><em>Does your character have a lifetime goal, dream, or driving force?</em> Goals define characters well, and how far they are willing to go to attain that goal rounds them off.</p>
<h2 id="fighters">5.3: Fighters</h2>
<p>Fighters are capable of using any weapon style, to the limits of the <a href="#wielding-weapons">Wielding Weapons</a> section. They may use up to 2-point armor (heavy armor) for each hit location. They are not considered enchanted beings unless stated in the <a href="#enchanted-beings">Enchanted Beings Caveat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="being-a-realms-spellcaster">5.4: Being a Realms Spellcaster</h2>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>The magic system is based on a simple path setup. There are many different paths available to a spellcaster, with each path consisting of a list of spells. A spellcaster may choose to take as many as three paths of spells as they progress, with weapon use becoming more restricted as the number of paths learned increases. Being a spellcaster requires two things: a spellbook and knowledge of the magic system.</p>
<h3 id="spellbooks">Spellbooks</h3>
<p>All spellcasters must have a spellbook, which records details of the spells the spellcaster knows. It is a marshaling tool and cannot be stolen from the PC. A spellcaster must have their spellbook on their person in order to cast spells.</p>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of each spellbook must have the spellcaster’s IC and OOC name, their current weapon restriction, whether the spellcaster wears armor or not, and whether the spellbook is IC or OOC (see below).</li>
<li>Next, the spellbook must have a listing of each spell the character has learned, in order; each spell’s circle; the date each spell was learned; and a note if any spell is unlearned.</li>
<li>The spellbook must have a description of each spell known - including specific components learned for each spell - to which the spellcaster may refer as needed during play.</li>
<li>Lastly, the spellbook must list who taught the spell to the spellcaster on either the page of the spell’s description or the spell list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spellcasters may have a Spell Mastery section at the end of their spellbook. The Spell Mastery section is a list of spells which the spellcaster has learned during their PC’s lifetime. An entry in this list includes the spell’s name, who taught the spell to the spellcaster, and the date it was learned. Spells in this list cannot be cast, unless they are currently in a spellcaster’s path.</p>
<p>Spellbooks may be declared IC or OOC, and so noted on the title page (“IC” or “OOC” in large, clearly written letters). Any change in a spellbook’s IC or OOC status must take place between events, but requires no particular time to make any such change.</p>
<p>If a spellbook is declared IC, it can be read by other characters, and found and perused in a search. Spellcasters have no option to refuse to reveal their IC spellbooks, provided they are legally found in a search of the spellcaster’s person.</p>
<p>If a spellbook is declared OOC, the information summarized above is OOC information only and exists solely as a marshaling tool. It cannot be read by other characters or discovered in a search. Other information written in spellbooks may be read by others, at the owner’s discretion, such as rune sets, history, or lore.</p>
<p>A player may choose or need to replace their character’s spellbook. This could be due to such situations as loss, damage, illegibility, or a simple desire to improve it. The player should create a new spellbook with contents as close as possible to the prior one. In the case of swapping out an old spellbook which is still available, the required information in it must be copied over to the new one. In the case of the old spellbook being unavailable or unreadable, then the player must make their best effort to recreate the information in the original. At the next event where they play that character, they must inform the Event Holder or Magic Marshal and have it inspected. At the beginning of the spellbook, where their names and weapon restriction is written, they should note that they are replacing their spellbook along with the date and the signature of the inspecting Event Holder or Magic Marshal.</p>
<p>In all cases, spellbooks remain non-stealable items.</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-of-the-magic-system">Knowledge of the Magic System</h3>
<p>All spellcasters are responsible for knowing how the magic system works, specifically the spells they can cast. A spellcaster who misuses their spells is not allowed to claim ignorance as an excuse.</p>
<h3 id="spell-resets">Spell Resets</h3>
<p>During some Realms events, you may be told a spell reset has occurred. This means some portion of your magical resources have been restored to your PC. The specific effects of a spell reset will change from event to event, so be sure to ask the EH or MM for details.</p>
<h3 id="checking-in">Checking In</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, a spellcaster must check in their spellbook with the EH or the appointed MM before using or learning spells (see <a href="#attending-an-event">Section 1.4: Attending an Event</a> for more details).</p>
<h3 id="weapon-restrictions-and-magic">Weapon Restrictions and Magic</h3>
<p>Weapon restrictions are a matter of game balance. See below:</p>

<p>Your weapon restriction changes the moment you learn an additional path of magic. Spellcasters starting out know only one path (as they only know a single spell), and thus their restriction is Light.</p>
<p><em>For example:</em> Roderick is currently a one-path with five spells. He decides that using a bow and having more magic is more important than his hand-and-a-half, so he decides to keep learning spells. As soon as he learns his 6th spell, his restriction changes over to being Medial.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-weapon-restriction">Breaking Weapon Restriction</h3>
<p>A spellcaster may carry any weaponry they want, as long as they don’t wield them. In this context, wield means to make use of the weapon in any way, including hitting someone or blocking a blow, whether intentional or not. To wield a weapon outside of your weapon restriction is called “breaking weapon restriction.” (See <a href="#wielding-weapons">Wielding Weapons</a> in <a href="#weapon-rules">Section 3.7: Weapon Rules</a>.</p>
<p>If a spellcaster purposely breaks their weapon restriction, they suffer the consequences of their actions. They immediately lose all of their spells and become a fighter. Any lingering effects, such as <a href="#circle-of-protection">Circle of Protection</a> (but not a <a href="#circle-of-healing">Circle of Healing</a> or <a href="#mystic-forge">Mystic Forge</a>), last until broken or when spells next reset before going away. They are no longer a spellcaster, and function as a non-spellcaster in all ways for a minimum of one year. After that year is over, they may then decide to return to being a spellcaster, but must start over from scratch.</p>
<p>If they break their weapon restriction without realizing it, such as a blow being blocked by a weapon they are carrying for a friend, they have the option of either the previous penalty or taking the blow that was blocked. This decision must be made immediately.</p>
<h3 id="armor-2">Armor</h3>
<p>Armor restrictions are a matter of game balance. Spellcasters may only use light armor (1-point) but at a cost to wear it. See below:</p>
<table style="width:60%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 15%" />
<col style="width: 15%" />
<col style="width: 29%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tr class="odd">

<td>3</td>
<td>Top spell in each path</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, a spellcaster with two paths would be able to have 1st through 4th and 2nd through 5th, and call armor. This may only be done once; you cannot sacrifice the two highest spells of each path in order to be able to wear heavy armor. A spellcaster may choose to start their spellcasting career with this ability, in which case it must be noted in their spellbook. If not, they must spend one event without learning a spell for each path they know in order to gain the ability to wear armor. Similarly, it takes one event without learning a spell or changing weapon restrictions to give up wearing armor and regain the ability to learn their sacrificed spells.</p>
<p>If a Light restriction spellcaster learns more spells and becomes a Medial restriction spellcaster, upon learning their first spell in their second path, they must choose to either lose the ability to wear armor or their 5th circle spell in their first path.</p>
<p>A spellcaster who uses armor (calls “Armor” in response to a blow) in violation of their armor restriction is immediately faced with the same consequences as one who has broken their weapon restriction, and should refer to that section for details.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-characters">5.5: Multiple Characters</h2>
<p>You may have more than one character in this game. However, you may only play one PC per event unless you have EH permission to play multiple characters.</p>
<h2 id="knights-and-knightly-powers">5.6: Knights and Knightly Powers</h2>
<p>There are many knighthoods in the Realms. It is a great honour to be appointed as a knight, and sometimes this honour comes with special powers. For their service to the game, a Knight of the Eternal Flame may, once per calendar year, call “Knight” to protect themselves from one attack. A Knight of the Realms is allowed to do this once per event. Event Holders may choose to grant powers to members of other knighthoods.</p>
