# 1: General Player Information # {#general-player-information}
===============================================================

## 1.1: What is the Realms? ## {#what-is-the-realms}
----------------------------------------------------

The Realms is a medieval fantasy Live Action Role Playing (LARP) system (also
known as The Realms of Wonder). This game has been in existence since the late
1980s. The Realms has evolved considerably since its inception through the
participation and imagination of more people than can be credited. Unlike most
LARPs today, the Realms has a skill-based combat system, and is community-based
rather than run by a single, static council or corporation.

For those who are not familiar with what playing in a LARP entails, it is a lot
like acting. The difference is that while the event staff sets the stage, the
lines are all yours. You decide what “part” you want to play. Are you a mage, a
warrior, a noble, or all of the above? Once you arrive at the event site you
slip into your character. You stop acting like yourself and begin acting like
your new persona. The Realms uses foam-padded “weapons” to simulate combat and
has an intricate magic system to represent all sorts of things we wouldn’t be
able to do in real life. The system is designed to help resolve situations that
we cannot practically resolve on our own. Specifics of the Realms system will be
discussed in more detail later on. You're in the Realms now and you'll never be
quite the same again.

## 1.2: What is This Book? ## {#what-is-this-book}
--------------------------------------------------

The document you are reading is the official rulebook to the Realms. Covered
here you will find what you need to know about combat, magic, and other aspects
of playing the game.

Be sure to know the 2018 Omnibus rules, as well as any specific rules at each
event you attend. At their events, an Event Holder (a player who volunteers to
run an event, hereafter referred to as an EH) may choose to change some of the
rules, including (among other things) announcing special weapon calls, defining
special event-specific spells (Regional Magic), and allowing play-testing of new
rules.

The game rules and the rulebook are updated once a year by a council of EHs in
order to make the game more fun, make the game safer, clarify existing rules,
and encourage increased, improved role-playing. For more information on events
and the Realms, visit <realmsnet.net>.

## 1.3: How Do I Start Playing? ## {#how-do-i-start-playing}
------------------------------------------------------------

First off, read this rulebook. Read the whole thing. It is also a good idea to
re-read the Omnibus each year so you can be up-to-date on rules modifications
and changes that occur during the Event-Holders Council.

Next, you will need to make a character (the role you play while at events).
Characters are often referred to as Player Characters or PCs. This role will be
the vehicle you experience the Realms through. Creating a character is old hat
to many who have played tabletop role-playing games or other LARPs. If you are
unfamiliar with creating a character or want some tips, see [Part 5: Character
Creation.](#character-creation)

After creating a PC, the best way to become acquainted with the Realms is to
simply go to an event. Most people will be happy to explain to you what's going
on. There is so much that can happen at an event that it is better experienced
than explained. Attending practices is also helpful, as you not only become
acquainted with the combat system, but also get introduced to other players.

### Realms Events ###

An event is where the game is played. There are basically three kinds of events
in the Realms: Feasts, Tournaments, and Quests. Some events take on qualities of
all the types, but are predominantly one of the three. Here is what to expect at
each type:

Feasts
: Feasts, as the name implies, revolve around food. Political posturing and
  court are often held at feast events. There is generally little combat at a
  feast event, and they are usually held indoors in the wintertime. Bardics,
  games of chance or skill, and other such activities can usually be found at
  feasts. Feasts are often a good starting point for some players, particularly
  those more interested in role-playing than in combat.
Tournaments
: Tournament events usually feature contests of both individual and team martial
  skill. These are usually held as yearly events, and are generally a social
  occasion. Players more interested in combat and less interested in
  role-playing and magic find tournament events the best starting point for
  their Realms careers.
Quests
: Quest events are the traditional style of event for saving damsels in
  distress, finding and killing evil demons, and many other tasks. Nearly
  anything can happen at a quest event.

## 1.4: Attending an Event ## {#attending-an-event}
---------------------------------------------------

### Registration ###

A list of events can be found on realmsnet.net under the Realms Calendar or the
Events tab. Whenever you plan on attending an event, you should register for it
through realmsnet.net as some events may have caps on how many players can
attend, while others may have different registration requirements or pre-event
information to disperse to players who are planning on attending. Registering
for events also helps give the event staff an idea of how many players they
might expect, and helps them to plan accordingly. It is also important to
register any dietary or medical restrictions you may have.

### Check In ###

When you arrive at an event, there are a few things you must do before beginning
play:

### Event Fees ###

You must pay any event fees; failure to do so means you will not be able
participate in the event and may be asked to leave site. Some events will waive
event fees for staff or NPCs (Non Player Characters) however, you must alway
check with the event holder first. As event fees help pay for the site, props,
prizes, food, and costuming that goes into throwing events, without them future
events would not be able to occur.

### Waivers ###

You may be required to sign a waiver. Waivers serve two purposes: protection
for the EH(s) or the land owners from legal action, and to keep track of how
many people attended an event. Monitoring event attendance is the way for the
Event Holders' Council to determine whether or not an event is legal (more on
what makes a legal event in [Part 7: Realms
Administration](#realms-administration)).

### Magic Items ###

Magic items must be checked in with the EH or the event's Magic Marshal (MM)
before the start of the event. EHs and MMs must know about every magic item at
an event, so that the event can be adjusted, if necessary. EHs and MMs have the
right to fail or disallow any magic item at any time. Using a magic item at an
event without first gaining approval by the EH or MM is cheating.

### Magic ###

Spellcasters must check their spellbook with the EH or the event's MM to find
out whether any of their spells work differently at the event before they cast
any of their spells. Spellcasters with Regional Magic (see [Regional
Magic](#regional-magic)) also generally find out what their magic of the day is
at check-in. Using spells at an event without first gaining approval by the EH
or MM is cheating.

### Weapon Inspection ###

Before beginning play, you must inspect your own weapons before they are used.
If you are unsure of a weapon's safety, ask a marshal to inspect it for you. EHs
may require a designated marshal (referee) to inspect all weapons to make sure
they are safe for use. There must always be someone at an event who can be asked
to inspect weapons in case anyone does not feel comfortable inspecting their own
weapons. If a weapon is deemed unsafe, it is to be removed from play or
repaired.

## 1.5: Alcohol Policy ## {#alcohol-policy}
-------------------------------------------

Alcohol is not permitted unless explicitly allowed by the Event Holder. An event
advertised as damp or wet is informing attendants that alcohol is allowed in
accordance with state and federal laws.

# 2: Core Rules # {#core-rules}
===============================

## 2.1: Participant Rights ## {#participant-rights}
---------------------------------------------------

The Realms is committed to providing a space that feels as safe and inclusive as
possible. Participants in the Realms have the out-of-character rights to
personal safety and the expectation they will be treated with courtesy and
respect by all other participants in the Realms. Participants have the right to
bring concerns to a marshal or other responsible staff member with the
expectation of having them investigated and appropriately addressed.

Every player has an obligation to read and follow the rules of the Omnibus. EHs
understand that the game can be complex and the first step in dealing with
behavioral issues or cheating in most instances involves ensuring that the
player understands the rules.

However, if a rule is broken, or if there are repeated infractions, an EH may
impose consequences on any participant(s) at their event. These may include a
formal warning; removal from specific sections of an event; removal from an
event; not being allowed to use specific weapons, spells, or items; or
prosecution for violations of Federal and/or State law. If you are removed from
an event for rules violations, the EH is not obligated to refund your event fee.

If an EH subjects a player to a consequence at their event they should notify
all other EHs of this via the Event Holders' List. The player involved must
receive a copy of this notification and may send a formal response. People who
want to bring formal charges should report such charges to the Arbitration
Committee (<arbitration@lists.realmsnet.net>). In addition, any participant that
feels wrongful action was taken against them can bring the issue before the
Arbitration Committee (see [Section 7.3](#arbitration-committee).

An EH may opt to not allow a player who has a history of breaking rules to
attend their events, provided that player is notified in advance.

Event Holders have an obligation to take reports of rules violations at their
events seriously. Having an additional person present during the reporting is
strongly encouraged. If you report a violation to the EH of an event and are
ignored or no reasonable action is taken, bring the situation to the attention
of the Arbitration Committee. Event Holders who have a history of disregarding
reports of rules violations, or who do not address especially serious reports
may face penalties including, but not limited to, temporary loss of EH status,
un-backing of that EH’s magic item(s), revocation of an event’s legal status,
and/or being banned from holding future events.

Reports of rules violations to be submitted after the conclusion of an event
should be submitted to the AC.

## 2.2: Code of Conduct ## {#code-of-conduct}
---------------------------------------------

Anyone can report harassment or abuse. If someone’s behavior towards you has
violated your rights as a participant, or if you witness the same happening to
someone else, immediately report the incident to the event’s EH.

If you have reason to believe rules regarding the Code of Conduct may be
violated at an event, you should notify the Event Holder prior to the event
occurring.

The following list is not meant to be exhaustive, and any non-consensual
violations of a participant’s rights should be considered a violation of the
rules.

Any of the following constitute grounds for punitive action:
* Violating any federal, state, or local laws, facility rules, or event
  policies;
* Failure to comply with the instructions of the Event Holder or designated
  marshal;
* Using anything in an out-of-character threatening or destructive manner
  against person or property;
* Endangering the safety of oneself or others;
* Stealing (People’s tents, bags, packs, pouches, and possessions are completely
  off-limits and out-of-play. There are no exceptions, even if officially
  in-play items are concealed therein);
* Drinking alcohol under the age of 21, or providing alcohol to those under age
  21;
* Physical or verbal intimidation or abuse;
* Stalking;
* Inappropriate physical contact or proximity. Any form of unwanted physical
  contact is strictly forbidden;
* Non-consensual sexual acts (a person under the age of consent cannot consent
  to sexual acts);
* Inappropriate sexual attention, whether verbal or physical, or continued
  attention after being asked to stop (sexual attention towards those legally or
  physically unable to consent is always inappropriate, this includes people
  under the age of consent);
* Harassment for any reason, including out-of-game attributes such as race,
  weight, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or disability.

Role-play can never be used as an excuse for any of these behaviors. If you are
informed that your role-playing is OOC unsafe, threatening, or is not consented
to by other participants you should stop immediately and find another way to
play out the scene.

## 2.3: The Safety Rules ## {#the-safety-rules}
-----------------------------------------------

The safety rules are out-of-character (hereafter referred to as OOC). They are
for our safety, and provide the guidelines that we should all be playing by.

### The Rules We Play By ###

1. We should all be doing this to have fun. If you get mad or uncontrolled, it
   is up to you to remove yourself from the game until you have regained your
   composure.
#. This is a sport of personal honor; treat it as such. You are responsible for
   keeping track of many aspects of this game, such as weapon blows and known
   spells. Failure to report or accurately respond to any of these aspects is
   cheating and a stain on your personal honor.
#. You must listen to the marshals at all times; they are the referees. If you
   are caught breaking the rules, a marshal may remove you from all or part of
   that event.
#. Report any safety concerns to a marshal immediately. If you have any
   questions, it is up to you to ask.
#. HOLD: If you see a harmful or unsafe situation (e.g., someone is about to run
   into a tree, gets their glasses knocked off, has had their weapon really
   broken in combat, is about to fall off a cliff, etc.) yell the word "Hold."
   If someone is injured, it is the primary responsibility of the person who is
   hurt to call a Hold. Before calling a Hold for someone else in an otherwise
   safe situation, you must first ask if they are all right. Holds should only
   be called in the event of a dangerous situation, and should never be used to
   discuss the rules. If you hear the word "Hold," stop immediately, then say
   "Hold" until everyone else has stopped moving. Once the emergency has been
   dealt with, a "Lay-On" (continue play) will be called either by a qualified
   marshal, or the person who originally called the Hold. Do not resume play
   until a Lay-On has been called.
#. Only weapons and shields that have been made following the construction
   guidelines (see [Section 3.8: Weapon Construction](#weapon-construction)) are
   to be used. Weapons should be checked between combat situations to ensure
   continued safety. A qualified marshal may be requested to check the safety of
   any weapons or shields at any time. Any new designs or materials must be
   inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal before use.
#. There is to be NO real steel in any combat situation, or in any potential
   combat situation, at any time. Real steel is defined as metal knives, swords,
   axes, darts, spikes, spurs, etc. - anything that could really hurt a
   participant. Real steel that is sheathed is still a potential hazard.
#. Acts considered unlawful in the real world, such as theft of non-game items
   or assault, are also unlawful in the Realms. For the safety of all
   participants, any form of unwanted physical contact is strictly forbidden.
#. Any spell props, weapon props, or materials not specifically allowed within
   the Omnibus must be inspected and approved by the EH or a designated marshal
   before they are used.
#. While the wording of the game rules may occasionally be less than clear,
   players should not use any such confusion to their own advantage. A simple
   guideline is to not assume any benefits unless they are specifically granted
   by a rule. If you feel that the way a rule is written grants you an advantage
   by omission of a statement to the contrary, you must review that rule with a
   marshal or EH prior to utilizing that advantage. While this document has a
   lot of general rules (such as [Section 6.1: Basic Magic Effects Everyone
   Should Know](#basic-magic-effects-everyone-should-know)), any specific rule
   will always override these general rules.

### The Rules We Fight By ###

11. This is a lightest touch sport. ANY contact with a weapon to a body is to be
    taken as a hit. Ignoring a "light" blow is cheating and a marshal may remove
	you from the fight. There are to be NO full-strength swings. A marshal may
	remove you for excessive blow strength. Weapons, melee and missile, should
	be used with the minimum force necessary to score a successful hit.
#.  The face (eyebrows to chin) and throat area are "off-target." Do not aim for
    these areas. You may choose not to accept a blow that hits you solely in
	these areas, but you must call the location that was hit. For instance, if
	you are hit in the face, call "Face," and keep fighting if you wish. This
	alerts both the other combatant and the marshal that you have taken an
	illegal blow. It is not unusual for shots to an off-target area to also
	strike legitimate areas in the same strike. You must take all legal blows,
	even if an off-target area was hit by the same strike. For example, a shot
	thrown at your head may hit your face if you pull back, but if it touches
	your forehead in the process, that is a legal blow.
#.  In combat, there is to be contact with weapons only (e.g., weapons hitting
    weapons, weapons hitting bodies, and weapons hitting shields only). There is
	to be NO body contact of any kind (e.g., no shoving, punching, kicking,
	biting, grabbing, etc.). Do NOT grab an opponent's weapons and/or shield.
#.  Do NOT charge. Charging is defined as running at someone so that they have
    to get out of your way to avoid illegal contact.
#.  Shields are for blocking ONLY. Your shield should never be used as a weapon.
    Shield-bashing or other shield contact with another person is unsafe.
#.  Pommels, no matter how padded, are not legal striking surfaces. Do not punch
    or thrust with the pommel of a weapon.
#.  Do NOT ever throw a weapon at a participant, unless that weapon is of a type
    (magic missile, javelin, or lightning bolt) sanctioned by the rules for
	throwing. No thrown weapon or missile weapon should strike a participant
	above the shoulders.
#.  Arrows should be drawn with minimal pull necessary to score a successful
    hit. Bows should NEVER be used to parry an attack. As with thrown weapons,
	arrows should not strike a participant above the shoulders.

# 3: Combat in the Realms # {#combat-in-the-realms}
===================================================

## 3.1: The Combat System ## {#the-combat-system}
-------------------------------------------------

The Realms uses a lightest-touch system for its combat system. That means that
no matter how lightly your opponent may touch you with their weapon, you have to
take the shot. This is to keep the sport friendly, so that everyone can play.
This system does not allow for "scratches" or "light blows" - you must take
these shots as normal blows. In all cases, the phrase, "if you are struck,"
refers to any time you are struck by the padded surface of any weapon or spell
prop that does damage as a weapon.

### Hit Locations ###

Your body is separated into seven locations of which there are two kinds. Your
arms and legs are "limbs," while your head and the front and back of your torso
are "kill locations." If you become confused about exactly where one location
stops and another begins, thinking of a Barbie™ doll may help. The buttocks of a
person are considered leg shots. If you are hit in the buttock(s), you lose the
appropriate leg(s).

### Killing Blows ###

If you are struck in a kill location your PC is dead (see [Section 3.4:
Character Death](#character-death) and [Section 3.5: Scalping](#scalping) for
more details).

If you are hit on the top of the shoulder, your PC is dead. If you are wearing
armor, a blow to the top of the shoulder is considered a blow to the front or
back depending on whether your opponent is in front of you or behind you.

### Limb Shots ###

If you are struck in a limb, your PC loses the use of that entire limb. If you
are struck in a limb that has already been lost, and that limb blocked what
could have possibly been a legal shot to another location, then that location
should be considered hit. You cannot protect the side of your PC's body with a
disabled arm or by lifting a disabled leg up to block. Once your PC's limb has
been disabled, it should be put behind you. This keeps it out of the way as well
as provides a visual cue to other players that your PC is hurt. Once you have
lost a limb, your PC cannot use that limb at all. Don't limp on a damaged leg.

### Hand-on-Weapon ###

If you are struck on a hand that is holding anything that is legal to block or
parry with (weapons and shields, but not bows, javelins or arrows), it is
considered gauntleted and immune to damage. When this happens, call out "Hand"
or "Hand-on-weapon." If you are struck on a hand that is not holding anything
you can parry with, even if you have just taken it off for a second, it is
considered a legal limb shot and your PC has to suffer the consequences. Your
hand is considered everything below the wrist bone.

### How to Take Multiple Hits ###

Should an opponent's weapon (be it a melee weapon, missile weapon, or spell
prop) hit you in more than one location with the same swing, all points of
contact count as hits.

## 3.2: Combat Etiquette ## {#combat-etiquette}
-----------------------------------------------
